// Javascript Array //


let arr = ["egg", "milk", "bread",];  // Arrays are wrapped in square brackets. [] //
console.log(arr[0]); // Access the Array >>>> arr[0] >>>> displays milk on the console log // 
// The Array index always starts from 0. //


// Although its possible you can put numbers and Boolean in the above Array its not good practice. // 
// Best practice is to separate them >>>> numbers Array >>>>> Boolean Array //

// We put things inside loops so that they can be executed repeatedly//
